# coderbyte-challenges-nodejs
The code presented here are a reflection of how I tackle Node.js RESTful solutions by answering some of the challenges presented on CoderByte.com. It is meant to further showcase how I approach problem solving within a test driven development methodology with an ES6 environment, while keeping my mind sharp. While the solutions themselves may appear overkill to some, my approach to this is that everything should be test-able and, dare I say, bulletproof.

## Disclaimer
The challenges themselves are owned by CoderByte. These are just my solutions and methodologies to them.
