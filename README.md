# coderbyte-challenges-nodejs
The code presented here are a reflection of how I tackle Node.js RESTful solutions by answering some of the challenges presented on CoderByte.com. It is meant to further showcase how I approach problem solving within a test driven development methodology with an ES6 environment. While the solutions themselves may appear overkill to some, my approach to this is that everything should be test-able and, dare I say, bulletproof.
